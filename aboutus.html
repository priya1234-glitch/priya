<h1>Unique Gifts You Won’t Find Anywhere Else</h1>

To make sure that we take the ones who land on www.oyehappy.com by surprise, we have handcrafted over 500 unique gift ideas you won’t find anywhere else in the country. We spend hours ideating, days designing and weeks crafting the most creative range of Birthday Gifts and Anniversary Gifts, among others.

<h1>Innovative Gifting Categories Introduced for the First Time in India</h1>
Back in the 90s, gifting meant cakes, flowers or cards. 30 years later, nothing much changed – until we stepped in. Oye Happy is the first in the country to introduce innovative product categories to evolve the traditional way of gifting. Our range of Naughty Gifts, for instance, has given Indians a choice to gift board games and first night hampers to their partner. For those who aren’t materialistic and are looking for eco-friendly gifts for mothers or elders, they can choose from our range of social gifts and donate to a cause on the special person’s behalf. We have introduced several innovations in greeting cards in the form of LED-equipped cards, musical cards, and interactive cards. Similarly, we have changed the concept of gift hampers by introducing several personalised gifts and concept-based ideas to keep your loved one surprised throughout the day, week or month.

<h1>Personalised Gifts for Every Relationship</h1>
When you get a gift for someone you truly care about, you don’t want the gesture to be forgotten the next day. Research proves that over 74% of people want their gift to be something the receiver has never seen before. After all, a gift that your loved one can otherwise easily purchase from the market tends to lose its emotional connect. To show that you’ve put thought behind choosing the right surprise, people prefer the gift to be personalised especially for that person alone. We understand. On www.oyehappy.com, you can personalise anything – be it a funny gift for a sister,  special gift for your wife, a romantic gift for a fiance or a nostalgic gift for long-distance relationships.

<h1>Customised Gifts for Every Occasion</h1>
We understand the pressure of getting the first Valentine’s Day gift for your wife or getting a Secret Santa gift for your boss as Christmas gift. We understand that the traditional rakhis are no more as appreciated by the social media generation as customisable photo rakhis or name rakhis. And if the occasion is one that happens once in a lifetime and special as the ring ceremony, then your engagement gift becomes as important as the ring itself. Today, a gift is no more just a societal obligation but a validation of your love and thoughtfulness. That’s why you will find our range of wedding gifts to be very different from our range of Valentine’s Day Gifts. Browse the website today and find this out for yourself.
